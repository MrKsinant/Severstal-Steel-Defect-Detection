# Severstal-Steel-Defect-Detection
The goal of this project is to study a challenge proposed through Kaggle by Severstal in 2019, with the aim to develop a deep learning model able to detect defects on flat steel sheets, which are key elements the company works on. Particularly, in this projet, to tackle the problem, Detectron2 and TorchServe frameworks were mobilized.
