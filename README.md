# Severstal Steel Defect Detection

The goal of this project is to study a challenge proposed through Kaggle by Severstal in 2019, with the aim to develop a deep learning model able to detect defects on flat steel sheets, which are key elements the company works on. Particularly, in this projet, to tackle the problem, **Detectron2** (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and **TorchServe** (https://github.com/pytorch/serve) frameworks were mobilized.

For this project, a challenge proposed through **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com) by **Severstal** (https://www.severstal.com/eng/) in 2019 is going to be studied: [Severstal: Steel defect detection, can you detect and classify defects in steel?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection)

The goal of this challenge was to help the company to develop a computer vision model able to detect and to classify defects on flat steel sheets, which are key elements Severstal works on. Indeed, after having created Russia's largest industrial data lake, with petabytes of data that were previously discarded, the company is now looking to machine learning to improve automation, increase efficiency, and maintain high quality in their production. The production process of flat steel sheets is especially delicate: From heating and rolling, to drying and cutting, several machines touch flat steel by the time itâ€™s ready to ship, and today, Severstal wants to use images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm, with the aim to keep manufacturing standards for steel high and enable the company to continue its innovation and maintain its leading role in metallurgy.

Particularly, in this projet, to tackle the problem, **Detectron2** (https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and **TorchServe** (https://github.com/pytorch/serve) frameworks were mobilized.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:
* The file ***severstal-environment.yml***, the Conda environment file, with all packages and versions, to reproduce the work performed during this project;
* The folder ***graphs***, which contains all the graphs obtained during the study;
* The folder ***images***, which contains the images used to illustrate the challenge;
* The folder ***notebooks***, which contains all the Jupyter notebooks used to tackle the problem exposed in the challenge;
* The folder ***torchserve***, which contains all the files needed to serve, thanks to TorchServe, the Detectron2 model we trained, and equally all the files generated by running a session.

*Nota Bene:* Due to the weight of the files they contain, the folders *data* and *models*, mentioned in the Jupyter notebooks, are not provided here (as well as *detectron2_model.pth* and *severstal_detectron2.mar* files in *torchserve* folder).
